# Rant
Can't believe people are paying 18 SOL !!!$4500!!! for this lmfao

Infinity AIO / Infinity Scripts / Infinity Bundler is one of the most prominent bundlers. People pay crazy amounts just to use this solana bundler and yet the script is so easily cracked and the owner uses a license which allows public redistribution lmfao. Infinity is the best public bundler but way too expensive.
